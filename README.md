#HW3 â€“ Author Identification by Machine Learning
Matthew Spohrer



## Author ID by ML

1. Run features.py in the same directory as the .txt files in "pdx-cs-ai /
hw-authors" (not in the hacked or original dir). It will read in all .txt 
files so please only include those.

2. Running features.py will create par_words.csv which contains all of the
paragraphs and, for each paragraph, which words are present in that paragraph
in the psam format. It took about 7.9 seconds on linuxlab.

3. I ran id3 and the naive-bayes with par-words.csv.

## ~~What the code actually does.~~ What the code hopefully does

My program reads in each of the .txt files as lists of lines and builds the 
paragraphs and removes punctuation as it runs. It then calculates the information 
gained by splitting on all the words both authors used in all four books as long
were used 10 times or more. That threshold is kind of arbitrary but it seemed to
 work well. This prevented splitting on random one-off words or typos.
 
 It then outputs to a file named par-words.csv in the psam format of 
 author-title.paragraph number, author code (0 for Austen, 1 for Shelly), and a 
 list of comma separated zeros and ones (zero for the corresponding word not in
 the paragraph or a one if the word is in the paragraph). 

## The laughable development Process

oof! I had a hard time with this one. It was conceptually fun to think about 
but I struggled to get motivated and actually sit down and write the code. I
basically just built the ability to read in and process into paragraphs one day 
and then do the calculations and output a second day. It took me way longer than
it should have. I graduate this quarter so I've had a hard time being motivated...

## How it went

It went fine, considering. Running it with the minimum number of uses set to 10
and 300 words to split on with id3.py gave me ~83% while increasing the threshold
to 100 reduced it to about 78%. At 10 for the lower threshold and 400 for the 
number of words to split on, I got a marginal drop of about 1.5% in its 
accuracy.

As much as I struggled to sit down and write it, I think this was my favorite 
project so far.

## Left to do

I think I did everything; however, I had plans to do all the bonus stuff as well.
Unfortunately, I have absolutely no motivation right now and I just started an
internship. So, if I have time before the due date, I'll come back and add more.

Thanks for a great class!
